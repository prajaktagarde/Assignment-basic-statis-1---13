Q13) What is the nature of skewness when mean and median of data are equal?
Ans: No skewness is present we have a perfect symmetrical distribution

Q14) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median?
Ans: Skewness and tail is towards Right

Q15) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?

Ans: Skewness and tail is towards left

Q16) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data?
Ans: Positive kurtosis means the curve is more peaked and it is Leptokurtic

Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?
Ans: Negative Kurtosis means the curve will be flatter and broader


Q18) Answer the below questions using the below boxplot visualization.
What can we say about the distribution of the data?
 Ans: The above Boxplot is not normally distributed the median is towards the higher value

What is nature of skewness of the data?
 Ans: The data is a skewed towards left. The whisker range of minimum value is greater than maximum

What will be the IQR of the data (approximately)?
 Ans: The Inter Quantile Range = Q3 Upper quartile – Q1 Lower Quartile = 18 – 10 =8

Q19) Comment on the below Boxplot visualizations?
Draw an Inference from the distribution of data for Boxplot 1 with respect Boxplot 2.
 Ans: First there are no outliers. Second both the box plot shares the same median that is approximately in a range between 275 to 250 and they are normally distributed with zero to no skewness neither at the minimum or maximum whisker range.
